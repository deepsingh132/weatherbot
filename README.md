# üå¶Ô∏è WeatherBot

This **WeatherBot** is a Telegram bot that provides users with real-time weather updates and personalized location-based forecasts. It is powered by the OpenWeatherMap API and offers a seamless experience for users to get weather information instantly.

Additionally, the project includes an **admin control panel backend** for managing user preferences, locations, and bot functionality.

Built with the lightweight and robust **grammY** framework for Telegram bot development, the bot is designed to handle user interactions efficiently, while the server handles data validation, persistence, and API integrations.
